redTime version 0.22
================================================================================

Installation:

redTime relies on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), available at https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ .  Once this has been installed, edit the PATHS variable in Makefile to include the locations of the GSL headers and libraries.  Then compile redTime using 'make' from the command prompt.

Parallelization in redTime uses OpenMP.  The code may be compiled without parallelization by deleting the "-fopenmp" flag in the Makefile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running:

redTime is run directly from the command prompt.  It requires:

  1.  a file params_redTime.dat listing the cosmological parameters and 
      code inputs, as detailed in the comments to the sample 
      params_redTime.dat file included; 

  2.  a transfer function at redshift 0, in the standard 7-column format 
      produced by the CAMB code (https://camb.info), and named as specified
      in params_redTime.dat; and,

  3.  if running with massive neutrinos, then a series of higher-redshift
      transfer functions.

A sample params_redTime.dat file and corresponding CAMB transfer function files are included with the code.  Also included is a file 'example_redTime_result.dat' produced with the included parameter and transfer files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Results:

At each redshift requested in params_redTime.dat, redTime produces a 17-column table of results.  The columns are:

  column:	quantity:

  1		wave number k [h/Mpc]
  2		CDM+Baryon growth factor D normalized to 1 at z=0
  3		logarithmic growth derivative d ln(D) / d ln(a)
  4		linear CDM+Baryon power spectrum
  5		ratio B_nu(k,z) of linear neutrino to CDM+Baryon density 
		  contrasts, normalized to 1 at z=0
  6             logarithmic derivative d ln(B_nu) / d ln(a)
  7		linear neutrino power spectrum
  8		non-linear CDM+Baryon density-density spectrum
  9		non-linear CDM+Baryon density-velocity spectrum, where
		  velocity refers to the scalar velocity potential
		  theta = -divergence(v) / (a*H)
  10		non-linear CDM+Baryon velocity-velocity spectrum
  11		mu^2 component of the A(k,mu) RSD correction term from 
		  Taruya, Nishimichi, and Saito, Phys.Rev. D82 (2010) 063522
		  [arXiv:1006.0699] [TNS2010]
  12		mu^4 component of A(k,mu) from [TNS2010]
  13		mu^6 component of A(k,mu) from [TNS2010]
  14		mu^2 component of the B(k,mu) RSD correction from [TNS2010]
  15		mu^4 component of B(k,mu) [TNS2010]
  16            mu^6 component of B(k,mu) [TNS2010]
  17            mu^8 component of B(k,mu) [TNS2010]

Preceding each table of results is a comment line beginning with a pound sign '#' and listing the scale factor and redshift.  The dimensionful quantities H (Hubble parameter) and sigma_v^2 (linear velocity dispersion length scale) are also listed, in units of Mpc/h raised to the appropriate power, with the speed of light c = 1.  (Thus, for example, H at z=0 is always 0.0003336, or 100 km/sec divided by the speed of light.)

Tuning performance and outputs:

Default code performance parameters have been chosen for a combination of speed and accuracy.   For greater accuracy as well as combatibility with the earlier redTime version 0.1 (available at http://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/pert.html) at the cost of speed, the following quantities may be modified prior to compilation of redTime:

  1.  In the function Beta_P(double, input_data) in the file 
      AU_cosmological_parameters.h, k_min may be changed to 1e-5 and
      k_max to 20.

  2.  In the function D_dD(double,input_data,double*), also in the file
      AU_cosmological_parameters.h, n_lnk may be changed to 1000 and 
      a_early to 1e-50.

  3.  In the file redTime.cc the number of k steps nk may be increased to 256,
      and the size of the extrapolated power spectrum np may be reduced from
      4*nk to 8*nk.

The output format and set of quantities printed may be modified prior to compilation.  In the file redTime.cc, PREC controls the number of decimal places printed by the code.  Setting PRINTA, PRINTI, PRINTQ, or PRINTBIAS to 1 includes among the outputs A_{acd,bef}, I_{acd,bef}, Q^{\ell}_{abc}, or the bias integrals of McDonald and Roy, JCAP 0908 (2009) 020 [arXiv:0902.0991], respectively, as summarized in Upadhye, JCAP 1905 (2019) no.05, 041 [arXiv:1707.09354].  

In cosmologies with scale-dependent growth factors, such as those with massive neutrinos, the redshift at which 1-loop mode-coupling integrals are computed may affect the results.  This redshift is called z1l in the file redTime.cc and is set to 10 by default.  For compatibility with the earlier redTime version 0.1, set z1l = C.z_in()) .
